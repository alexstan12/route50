# route50

Route50 is a web-application meant to help individuals that deliver goods, so that they can easily set their route with more than 25 locations(Google Maps limit).
I created this as a response to the struggle that I've experienced in my previous job, while trying to deliver my products to the clients and couldn't esily set a route for the next day(at least not for free).

Here is a quick view of its functionality: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjCzBCc-Zt8&t=1s&ab_channel=AlexS
